                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Ryan Furrer and I am a 27 year old aspring Front-End Web Developer. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer with enough study and experience.</p><br>
                    <p>I graduated high school in 2009 and intended to graduate with a degree in Music Education & Music Performance. That did not play out as I attended school for the following 5 years with nothing but a pile of debt to show for it.  Programming and coding was a constant interest of mine but I never thought to make more of it than just that - an interest.</p><br>
                    <p>After leaving school to work full-time, it wasn't until the summer of 2018 that I decided to give Front-End Web Development a shot. I was unfocused and as my schedule became more busy my time learning to code diminshed.</p><br>
                    <p>Enter June, 2019 when I decided to buckle down and make this my career. I had been lightly following trends in the indusy for the past 2 years and wanted to create. Since June I have been devoting at least 2 hours per day, at least at least 5 days a week in learning these languages. I hope you feel that I can bring something new and fresh to the table at your company.</p>
